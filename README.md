DIY FPV Racing Drone built from scratch in Acro mode. Full project documentation, components, and future AI-based upgrades.


# FPV Racing Drone Project – Acro Mode

🛠️ A personal project to build a fully custom FPV racing drone in **Acro mode**, assembled over several months using components sourced from AliExpress.  
This project is focused on gaining hands-on experience with drone hardware, flight control, tuning, and eventually integrating AI capabilities.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a responsive, fast, and agile FPV racing drone in **Acro mode** (manual control with no stabilization).
- Learn and experiment with drone electronics, assembly, PID tuning, and flight behavior.
- Document the entire process and share open-source knowledge with others.
- Prepare the platform for future AI integration (e.g., object tracking, obstacle avoidance, autonomous maneuvers).
